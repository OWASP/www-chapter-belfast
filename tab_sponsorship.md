There are many ways you can help the OWASP Belfast Chapter spread the word about computer security and secure coding. Including the following:

- If you have a room available to hold a meeting, let us know.
- Companies can cover the OWASP membership costs of their employees.
- Supply a speaker on a topic of interest to the OWASP Belfast members, or cover their costs to present.
- Sponsor food and drink for a session.
- Further sponsorship can be provided directly to the Foundation, please refer to refer to the [policy and procedures](/www-policy/) on the website and the [board resolutions](/www-board/) on restricting the gift.
- Sponsors that donate to the Foundation are listed on our supporter page and at the bottom over every website page on our website.
