There are many ways you can help the OWASP Belfast Chapter spread the word about computer security and secure coding. Including the following:

If you have a room available to hold a meeting, let us know.
Companies can cover the OWASP membership costs of their employees.
Supply a speaker on a topic of interest to the OWASP Belfast members, or cover their costs to present.
Sponsor food and drink for a session.
Further sponsorship can be provided directly to the OWASP Belfast Chapter itself, using the link above. Direct sponsorship allows the OWASP Belfast Board to use the funds as needed to run events.
In return for any sponsorship we can add your company to our list of sponsors on the OWASP Wiki and Meetup sites, and share communications with session attendees. Contact the OWASP Belfast Board (right) for more details.
