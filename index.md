OWASP Belfast is just one of over 100 OWASP Chapters around the world, including 4 in Ireland and 12 in the UK, where people meet to learn about and discuss software security topics. The OWASP organization also has lots of active projects that volunteers can participate in to create code and documents for the worldwide security community. The OWASP Top 10 project is the most famous of those projects.
